# Evan-Kanetkar-about-me-homepage
this is a small about me page that I created for an internet programing class, it was part of a larger webpage project containing the about me pages of a few other students.
it contains basic information about me as a student and some of the work i've done
the about me page html and css files will need to be downloaded to your desktop where you can click to access them. 
to open the web page you need to double click the html file, and to view the code, you need to double click the css file
Unfortunately, due to the size of the image files included on the actual homepage, uploading them was not possible, so it may look a little bare, but the bones are there nonetheless. 
the css file shows all the code dictating where everything is on the page. 
the html file directs you to the homepage itself
